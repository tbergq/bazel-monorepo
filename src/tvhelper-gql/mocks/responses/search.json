The only survivors were the 400 inhabitants of 12 international space stations that were in orbit at the time.

Draconian measures including capital punishment and population control are the order of the day, as the leaders of the Ark take ruthless steps to ensure their future, including secretly exiling a group of 100 juvenile prisoners to the Earth's surface to test whether it's habitable.</p>",

He could bend spoons and lift objects with his mind from a young age, but he slowly began to withhold from using his abilities in public due to the negative attention he kept receiving. Now, the only thing he wants is to become friends with a girl in his class, Tsubomi. With his psychic \"mentor\" (who has no psychic powers), he continues his daily life, attempting to realize his purpose in life.</p>",
